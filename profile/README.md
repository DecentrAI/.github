# Intro

What is **Naeural**? Naeural or in its complete form "Naeural Edge Protocol" is the Operating System for Artificial Intelligence powered both by AI and Blockchain technologies. Our vision at Naeural is to truly democratize Artificial Intelligence by creating a network of shared resources for easy end-to-end development and deployment of AI applications. **Naeural** makes AI accessible and profitable for anyone, through a near-infinite range of applications which are hosted within an ecosystem that’s intuitive and even generates revenue for those actively involved. Simply put: “*AI power for the people*”. Imagine a world in which computers and mobile devices throughout the world provide AI solutions for a range of tasks and projects which matter to individuals, and large and small organizations alike.

Naeural will solve the following main technic and economical problem: *Providing easily accessible and go-to-market AI that is non-cost-prohibitive as it utilizes trustless micro-transactions, which requires only consumer or retail computer devices running Naeural software and meets the needs of developers, compute providers, and non-AI experts alike*.

Our project ecosystem will create a utility blockchain network where AI processing nodes will:

- collaborate and perform jobs based on real-life use cases;
- generate earnings for the node owners who provide services to the network;
- generate direct income for service provider network participants—such as developers, maintainers, and other stakeholders

# Cutting edge of AI & Blockchain

Our **Naeural** initiative, delineated in the [foundational paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08708), champions the democratization of AI via a **Decentralized Neuro-symbolic Autonomous processing framework**, or Naeural DNA in short. This avant-garde framework integrates diverse data sources, propelling rapid deployment of business rules through user-friendly low-code and no-code interfaces. Anchored by its own SDK/API for fast application development, it leverages the immense capabilities of Large Language Models.

Naeural stands at the forefront of economic and operational efficiency, integrating a **token-based system** for intelligent budgeting and scaling. The platform's compatibility with web3 and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ensures fluid blockchain interactions. It employs IoT-based protocols like MQTT, strengthened by signature-based validation and blockchain's inherent immutability, ensuring secure, reliable operations within a trustless infrastructure.

The Naeural vision coalesces with current digital transformation trends, aspiring to transform computing devices into profitable assets via a trustless processing power sharing model. This progressive strategy not only offers incentives to device owners but also aids in diminishing the AI industry's carbon footprint. By optimizing resource use, Naeural markedly decreases the time to launch AI-powered applications, fostering a more sustainable and economically sound AI ecosystem.

Extending this innovation, Naeural introduces multi-domain Large Language Model (LLM) based applications on the Naeural DNA. This enables the creation of versatile applications featuring time series predictive analytics, zero-shot-training for anomaly detection, and no-training-required video scene analysis, among others based on **state-of-the-art foundational models**. Designed for ease of development, these applications require no deployment or maintenance, operating within a decentralized, token-based budgeting and scalability framework. This amalgamation of advanced AI functionalities and decentralized processes positions Naeural as a transformative force in the AI domain, streamlining development and deployment for a future where AI is accessible and integral to every aspect of digital innovation.

## **Fast app development & go-to-market**

There are five features of Naeural revolutionary architecture aspects that enable fast development and deployment of AI in everyday life.

1. **Template-based ready-to-use software and compute infrastructure** are available for various applications, including but not limited to commercial safety & security, Smart City solutions, and blockchain gaming.
2. **Service providers** offer a highly optimized grid of decentralized nodes, which can augment compute power. For example, a grid of 16 Nvidia A100-80 GPUs can be “simulated” by 100-150 nodes using consumer-grade GPU computers (e.g. game consoles, mobile workstations, etc.).
3. **End consumers** can deploy their workload on free or partially-free nearby network nodes.
4. **Pay-as-you-go** processing fees are automatically, trustless and transparently distributed based on blockchain ledger technology.
5. **Legacy-based applications**, or outdated software systems, can be seamlessly integrated by forking base functionalities with complex business logic or **New applications** can use plugin-based execution pipelines with ready-to-use APIs and documentation.

No matter what you are planning to build and no matter how experienced programmer you and your team are, Naeural will help you to get your AI (and not only AI) project  up and running in no time. Say you need a horizontally scalable web-API with multiple endpoints with no need of MQTT, AI or even blockchain integration: you can do this by low-code defining our enpoints and deploying via ngrok your fleet of heterogenous distributed microservices.
